  <h2>Device extractors and device classes</h2>

  <p>
  KLayout provides two concepts for handling device variety: 
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><b>Device classes</b> are device categories. There are general categories such as
    resistors or MOS transistors. Specific categories can be created to represent specific
    incarnations - e.g. NMOS and PMOS devices. Device classes also determine how devices
    combine.</li>
    <li><b>Device extractors</b> are objects that analyze layout and produce devices. As for
    device classes, there are general device extractors. Each device extractor produces
    devices from a specific class.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Device classes</h2>

  <h3>Resistor (<class_doc href="DeviceClassResistor"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/res_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The plain resistor has two terminals, A and B. It features the following
  parameters:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>R</tt></b>: The resistance value in Ohm</li>
    <li><b><tt>L</tt></b>: The length in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>W</tt></b>: The width in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>A</tt></b>: The area of the resistor area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>P</tt></b>: The perimeter of the resistor area in µm</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Resistors can combine in parallel or serial fashion.
  </p>

  <p>
  In SPICE, plain resistors are represented by the "R" element.
  </p>

  <h3>Resistor with bulk terminal (<class_doc href="DeviceClassResistorWithBulk"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/res_with_bulk_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The resistor with bulk terminal is an extension of the plain resistor.
  If has the same parameters, but one additional terminal (W) which connects to 
  the area the resistor sits in (e.g. well or substrate).
  </p>

  <p>
  Resistors with bulk can combine in parallel or serial fashion if their
  bulk terminals are connected to the same net.
  </p>

  <h3>Capacitor (<class_doc href="DeviceClassCapacitor"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/cap_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The plain capacitor has two terminals, A and B. It features the following
  parameters:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>C</tt></b>: The capacitance value in Farad</li>
    <li><b><tt>A</tt></b>: The area of the capacitor area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>P</tt></b>: The perimeter of the capacitor area in µm</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  In SPICE, plain capacitors are represented by the "C" element.
  </p>

  <h3>Capacitor with bulk terminal (<class_doc href="DeviceClassCapacitorWithBulk"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/cap_with_bulk_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The capacitor with bulk terminal is an extension of the plain capacitor.
  If has the same parameters, but one additional terminal (W) which connects to 
  the area the capacitor sits in (e.g. well or substrate).
  </p>

  <p>
  Capacitors with bulk can combine in parallel or serial fashion if their
  bulk terminals are connected to the same net.
  </p>

  <h3>Diode (<class_doc href="DeviceClassDiode"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/diode_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  Diodes have two terminals, A and C for anode and cathode. Diodes 
  feature the following parameters:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>A</tt></b>: The area of the diode in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>P</tt></b>: The perimeter of the diode in µm</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Diodes combine in parallel (A to A and C to C). In this case
  their areas and perimeters will add.
  </p>

  <p>
  In SPICE, diodes are represented by the "D" element using the 
  device class name as the model name.
  </p>

  <h3>MOS transistor (<class_doc href="DeviceClassMOS3"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/mos3_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  Three-terminal MOS transistors have terminals S, G and D for source, gate and drain.
  S and D are commutable. They feature the following parameters:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>W</tt></b>: The gate width in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>L</tt></b>: The gate (channel) length in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>AS</tt></b>: The source area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>PS</tt></b>: The source perimeter in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>AD</tt></b>: The drain area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>PD</tt></b>: The drain perimeter in µm</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  MOS3 transistors combine in parallel when the source/drains and gates are connected
  and their gate lengths are identical.
  In this case their widths, areas and perimeters will add.
  </p>

  <h3>MOS transistor with bulk (<class_doc href="DeviceClassMOS4"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/mos4_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The four-terminal transistor is an extension of the three-terminal one and
  offers an additional bulk terminal (B). It is probably the most prominent 
  transistor device as the four-terminal version is compatible with the SPICE
  "M" element.
  </p>

  <p>
  MOS transistors with bulk can combine in parallel the same way the three-terminal
  versions do if their bulk terminals are connected to the same net.
  </p>

  <p>
  In SPICE, MOS4 devices are represented by the "M" element with the
  device class name as the model name.
  </p>

  <h3>Bipolar transistor (<class_doc href="DeviceClassBJT3"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/bjt3_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The three-terminal bipolar transistor can be either NPN or PNP type. 
  In KLayout, this device type can represent both lateral and vertical
  types. 
  The parameters are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>AE</tt></b>: The emitter area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>PE</tt></b>: The emitter perimeter in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>NE</tt></b>: The emitter count (initially 1)</li>
    <li><b><tt>AB</tt></b>: The base area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>PB</tt></b>: The base perimeter in µm</li>
    <li><b><tt>AC</tt></b>: The collector area in µm²</li>
    <li><b><tt>PC</tt></b>: The collector perimeter in µm</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Upon extraction, multi-emitter versions are extracted as multiple devices - one
  for each emitter area - and NE = 1. Bipolar transistors combine when in parallel.
  In this case, their emitter parameters AE, PE and NE are added.
  </p>

  <p>
  In SPICE, BJT3 devices are represented by the "Q" element with the
  device class name as the model name.
  </p>

  <h3>Bipolar transistor with substrate (<class_doc href="DeviceClassBJT4"/>)</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="/manual/bjt4_schematic.png"/>
  </p>

  <p>
  The four-terminal transistor is an extension of the three-terminal one and
  offers an additional bulk terminal (S).
  </p>

  <p>
  Bipolar transistors with bulk can combine in parallel the same way the three-terminal
  versions do if their bulk terminals are connected to the same net.
  </p>

  <p>
  In SPICE, BJT4 devices are represented by the "Q" element with four nodes and the
  device class name as the model name.
