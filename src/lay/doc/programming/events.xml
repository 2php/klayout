  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
  In some places, the API requires to attach code to an event. An event could be a menu item which is selected
  or a change of some status which might require some action. The API allows implementation of specific code which is
  called in that case. This enables us to implement initialisation functionality for example or the functionality
  behind a menu item. In this text we will refer to such functionality by the general term "callback". In general
  a callback is custom code that is called from the API in contrast to API code that is called from the custom code.
  </p>

  <p>
  There are basically two ways to attach specific code to a callback:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Reimplementation (Strategy Pattern)</b>: some API classes provide "virtual" methods. "virtual" is a C++ term and 
    means a method that can be overridden in a derived class. This technique is employed for example in the
    "Strategy" design pattern. In strictly typed C++ this is quite a common pattern which allows definition of interfaces 
    and concrete implementations based on those interfaces. Ruby as a dynamic language doesn't care much about
    classes and their relationship: an object either has a method or it hasn't. So, reimplementation is just a matter
    of providing the right method. An examples for the strategy pattern is the BrowserSource class (<class_doc href="BrowserSource"/>).
    </li>

    <li><b>Events</b>: events allow attaching a piece of code to an event. In Ruby, such a block is "Proc" object, in "Python" it is a
    "callable" object ("lambda function" is a term used in both languages for this kind of concept). 
    In case the event is triggered, this attached code is executed. Multiple lambda functions can be attached to the same event and 
    removed from the latter. Events can be cleared of attached code, where only the blocks attached from one language can be cleared
    together - code attached from Python cannot be cleared from Ruby.
    An example for events is the Action class (<class_doc href="Action"/>) which provides both the reimplementation interface 
    ("triggered" method) and the event interface ("on_triggered"). By the way, Qt signals are mapped to events in KLayout's Qt 
    binding (<link href="/programming/qt_binding.xml"/>).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reimplementation (Strategy Pattern)</h2>

  <p>
  The BrowserSource (<class_doc href="BrowserSource"/>) class is a nice example for the Strategy pattern.
  It is used by the BrowserDialog class (<class_doc href="BrowserDialog"/>) as a kind of internal HTML server
  which handles URL's starting with "int:". For this, a script has to provide a class that reimplements the "get(url)"
  method. In the following example, a BrowserSource is created that takes an URL with an integer index number and
  delivers a HTML text with a link to the URL with the next index.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here is the code:
  </p>

  <pre>module MyMacro
  
  include RBA
  
  class MyBrowserSource &lt; BrowserSource
    def get(url)
      next_url = url.sub(/\d+/) { |num| (num.to_i+1).to_s }
      "This is #{url}. &lt;a href='#{next_url}'&gt;Goto next (#{next_url})&lt;/a&gt;"
    end
  end
  
  dialog = BrowserDialog::new
  dialog.source = MyBrowserSource::new
  dialog.home = "int:0"
  dialog.exec

end</pre>

  <p>
  This example demonstrates how the "get" method is reimplemented to deliver the actual text.
  Ruby even allows reimplementation of a method without deriving a new class, because it allows
  to define methods per instance:
  </p>

  <pre>module MyMacro
  
  include RBA
  
  source = BrowserSource::new
  def source.get(url)
    next_url = url.sub(/\d+/) { |num| (num.to_i+1).to_s }
    "This is #{url}. &lt;a href='#{next_url}'&gt;Goto next (#{next_url})&lt;/a&gt;"
  end
  
  dialog = BrowserDialog::new
  dialog.source = source
  dialog.home = "int:0"
  dialog.exec

end</pre>

  <h2>Observer</h2>

  <p>
  Using the Observer pattern requires an additional object. Again reimplementation
  allows attaching custom functionality to the callback. In contrast to the Strategy pattern,
  the interface is very generic and can supply only few parameters, if there are parameters
  at all.
  </p>

  <p>
  An observer is an object of a class derived from the Observer class (<class_doc href="Observer"/>). 
  An example for a use case for the Observer is the LayoutView class (<class_doc href="LayoutView"/>). This class
  offers multiple events that indicate certain conditions. Here is some code:
  </p>

  <pre>module MyMacro
  
  include RBA
  
  class MyObserver &lt; Observer
    def signal 
      Application::instance.main_window.message("Selection changed", 1000)
    end
  end
  
  observer = MyObserver::new
  Application::instance.main_window.current_view.add_selection_changed_observer(observer)  
  
end</pre>

  <p>
  In this example, an observer is created and attached to the "selection_changed" event of
  LayoutView using "add_selection_changed_observer". When the selection changes, the "signal"
  method of the observer is called. By reimplementing that method we show a short message
  in the MainWindow's status bar.
  </p>

  <p>
  Because Ruby is a dynamic language and allows overriding of methods per instance, we can simplify
  the example further which avoids having to create a new class:
  </p>

  <pre>module MyMacro
  
  include RBA
  
  observer = MyObserver::new
  def observer.signal
    Application::instance.main_window.message("Selection changed", 1000)
  end

  Application::instance.main_window.current_view.add_selection_changed_observer(observer)  
  
end</pre>
  
  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>
  Events are the callback variant that is the easiest one to use. Using an event it is possible
  to directly attach a block of code to a callback. An event has a specific signature, i.e. 
  the parameters it provides. The block can obtain this parameters by listing them in it's argument list.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here is a simple example that uses the parameterless "on_triggered" event of the Action
  class (<class_doc href="Action"/>). It puts a new entry into the tool bar and if it is 
  clicked, it displays a message box:
  </p>

  <pre>module MyMacro
  
  include RBA
  
  action = Action::new
  action.on_triggered do
    MessageBox::info("A message", "The action was triggered", MessageBox::Ok)
  end
  action.title = "My Action"
  
  Application::instance.main_window.menu.insert_item("@toolbar.end", "my_action", action)
  
end</pre>

  <p>
  Specifying a block to an event will make the event only execute that block. A more flexible way of 
  controlling the code attached to events is available through the += and -= operators:
  </p>

  <pre>module MyMacro

  include RBA

  code = lambda do 
    MessageBox::info("A message", "The action was triggered", MessageBox::Ok)
  end

  action = Action::new
  action.on_triggered += code

  ...
  
  # to remove the code from the event, use:
  action.on_triggered -= code

  # to replace all event handlers by the one given by "code":
  action.on_triggered = code

  # to clear all event handlers use:
  action.on_triggered.clear
  </pre>

  <p>
  If the Qt binding is available (see <link href="/programming/qt_binding.xml"/>), Qt signals
  are available as events which simplifies the implementation of a Qt dialog. In this example,
  the "textChanged" signal of QLineEdit is attached a code block which copies the text of the 
  input field to the label below:
  </p>
  
  <pre>module MyMacro
  
  include RBA
  
  dialog = QDialog::new(Application::instance.main_window)
  layout = QVBoxLayout::new(dialog)
  input = QLineEdit::new(dialog)
  label = QLabel::new(dialog)
  layout.addWidget(input)
  layout.addWidget(label)

  # implement the textChanged signal as event:
  input.textChanged { |text| label.text = text }

end</pre>

  <p>
  Please note that unlike Qt signal/slots, this technique does not allow to attach multiple
  handlers to one event/signal.
  </p>
